### Discription

The PC guesses a random number from 1 to 100 and guesses it independently. The algorithm calculates the average number of guesses. This project will create a program that guesses the number at minimum attempts.

### CASE
To calculate the average number of guessing a number, it is necessary to write a program in which the pc guesses the number, and then call this program in another, final program. In the final program, will be created a list which the resulting numbers of the first program will be placed. Then the average of the list of numbers will be calculated.

### Data info
The program will use the numpy module.

### Steps
* first step: writing a program to count attempts to guess a number
* step two: write a program to calculate the average number of guesses out of 1000 calls to the first program
* And than using multiple conditions for reduce the average number of guessing

### Result
Many conditions reduces the average number of guesses, and also the more conditions, the lower the average. In my case the average number will be 9.
