### Discription

The PC guesses a random number from 1 to 100 and guesses it independently. The algorithm calculates the average number of guesses.
### CASE
To calculate the average number of guessing a number, it is necessary to write a program in which the pc guesses the number, and then call this program in another, final program. In the final program, a list will be created in which the resulting numbers of the first program will be placed. Then the average of the list of numbers will be calculated.
### Data info
The program will use the numpy module
### Steps
* first step: writing a program to count attempts to guess a number
* step two: write a program to calculate the average number of guesses out of 1000 calls to the first program
### Result
With seed=1 the average number of guesses will be 101
### The end
Bye
